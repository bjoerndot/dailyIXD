This button is like a dog. The arrow is on a leash... it just wants to go forward!!! And: DID YOU CLICK IT?</div><div class="feature__content__text">The button is a pure CSS button built with animations and transitions.</div></div></section><section class="feature" id="symboliclink"><div class="feature__content"><div class="infoLinks"><div class="infoLinks__text"> </div>This is a paragraph about the use of informative links. Do you know the feeling of seeing a link and having no idea, where it will lead you? As I see it, this is an issue as there are three possible ways it could turn out: Anchor Link; linking to content on the same page. Internal link - linking to another document on that site and external links. <a class="link">External link<span class="link__arrow link__arrow--external"></span></a> Often links are inside a paragraph!<div class="infoLinks__text"></div>Since there is more than external links: let's have a look at internal links! <a class="link">Internal Link<span class="link__arrow link__arrow--internal"></span></a><div class="infoLinks__text"></div>We should also consider anchor links, that just point to another section on the same page... <a class="link">Anchor Link<span class="link__arrow link__arrow--anchor"></span></a></div></div><div class="feature__content darkblue"><h2 class="feature__content__heading">Symbolic Links</h2><div class="feature__content__text">27.11. - What if a link told you already while hovering where it links to? Especially within text blocks I want to style links in a way, that they are distinct but don't break the flow of reading... by adding symbolic information on the link-hover it is possible to still convey important information for users.</div><div class="feature__content__text">The underline effect on the left is different for three cases: External links, internal links and anchor links. For external links the underlining arrows goes beyond the circle. Internal links show the arrow ending within in the circle but still separated from it. But the anchor link, which just leads the user to another section on the site, completely fills the circle.</div><div class="feature__content__text">This CSS-only solution combines an animation triggered by interaction while giving useful information to the users!</div></div></section><section class="feature" id="mousetracking"><div class="feature__content"><div class="mouseTracking"><div class="cat"><div class="cat__ears"></div><div class="cat__eyes"><div class="cat__eye"></div><div class="cat__eye"></div></div><div class="cat__face"></div></div></div></div><div class="feature__content pink"><h2 class="feature__content__heading">Mousetracking</h2><div class="feature__content__text">28.11. - Cat follows mouse...</div></div></section><section class="feature" id="tooltip"><div class="feature__content"><div class="example_tooltip"><a href="https://github.com/bjoerndot/dailyIXD" aria-label="https://github.com/bjoerndot/dailyIXD">Unprecise description of the link or just linked text-section</a><button class="close__button" aria-label="Click here to close something!"><div class="close__button__cross"> </div></button></div></div><div class="feature__content lightpink"><h2 class="feature__content__heading">Accessible Tooltips</h2><div class="feature__content__text">29.11. - Tooltips are useful! And if you ask me, they aren't used enough in web development. But it is fairly simple to add them!</div><div class="feature__content__text">All you need is one attribute on the element that shall get a tooltip and a handful lines of CSS-code...</div><div class="feature__content__text">And yet: these tooltips are special! Besides being a visisble aid for revealing link targets or explaining symbols, these tooltips also provide information for screen-readers.

The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.</p><p class="readMode__text__p">"I am going on to the other place," he said after a pause.</p><p class="readMode__text__p">"On the wharf?"</p><p class="readMode__text__p">"Yes."</p><p class="readMode__text__p">"That mad-cat is sure to be there.
